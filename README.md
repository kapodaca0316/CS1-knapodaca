| **Due Date** | 10/06/2022 |
| **Status** | completed |
| **Location** | https://github.com/kapodaca0316/CS1-knapodaca/blob/main/labs/functions/main.cpp |
| **Self Grade** | 65/100 |
| **Notes** | This is late and I don't think it's calculating the distance properly. I should have used pow I think. |

| **Status** | completed |
| **Location** | https://github.com/kapodaca0316/CS1-knapodaca/blob/main/labs/conditionals/main.cpp |
| **Self Grade** | 90/100 |
| **Notes** | I'm not positive I wrote the test function correctly |

### Lab #5

| **Location** | https://github.com/kapodaca0316/CS1-knapodaca/blob/main/assignments/loops/main.cpp |
| **Self Grade** | 100/100 |
| **Notes** | It took me a while to think it through because I was over complicating it in my head |

### Lab #6

| **Name** | Kyra Apodaca|
|:---|:---|
| **Name** | CS1 - Loops Lab |
| **Description** | The following lab demonstrates the usage of pointers, enum type and use-defi |

| **Status** | completed |
| **Location** | https://github.com/kapodaca0316/CS1-knapodaca/blob/main/labs/pointers/main.cpp |
| **Self Grade** | 100/100 |
| **Notes** | This one was fairly simple, I had a few minor bugs caused by not starting my while loop in the right spot, but that was easy to fix |

| **Notes** | I like doing Kattis problems a lot :) |

### Assignment #1

| **Name** | Kyra Apodaca|
|:---|:---|
| **Name** | HW - Std I/O |
| **Description** | Homework covering standard input and output, console will print out hang man gallows |
| **Due Date** | 09/12/2022 |
| **Status** | completed |
| **Location** | https://github.com/kapodaca0316/CS1-knapodaca/blob/main/assignments/studio/main.cpp |
| **Self Grade** | 95/100 |
| **Notes** | wrote and tested the input/output multiple times |

### Assignment #2

| **Name** | Kyra Apodaca|
|:---|:---|
| **Name** | HW - Triangle Maths |
| **Description** | Homework covering basic cmath calculations and tell whether triangle is real or not |
| **Due Date** | 09/26/2022 |
| **Status** | completed |
| **Location** | https://github.com/kapodaca0316/CS1-knapodaca/blob/main/assignments/triangle/main.cpp |
| **Self Grade** | 95/100 |
| **Notes** | I tested it a bunch, the way I wrote it makes it so that the way to tell if the triangle is real or not the third side must be the hypotenuse and entered last into the program. There is a better way to write that, I just don't know what that would be |

### Assignment #3

| **Name** | Kyra Apodaca|
|:---|:---|
| **Name** | Lab - Built-in and User Defined Functions & Automated Testing Lab |
| **Description** | Write a C++ program that prompts the user to enter two points on a 2D geometry and finds the distance between the two points |

| **Self Grade** | 65/100 |
| **Notes** | This is late and I don't think it's calculating the distance properly. I should have used pow I think. |

### Assignment #4

| **Name** | Kyra Apodaca|
|:---|:---|
| **Name** | HW - CLI Menu, Conditionals, Functions and Testing |
| **Description** | Write a CLI based menu-driven C++ program that computes sum, product, max, min, average, oddity of any 5 given numbers along with the following requirements. |
| **Due Date** | 10/17/2022 |
| **Status** | completed |
| **Location** | https://github.com/kapodaca0316/CS1-knapodaca/blob/main/assignments/conditionals/conditional.cpp |
| **Self Grade** | 90/100 |
| **Notes** | I didn't know how to calculate the oddity, so I commented that out so the rest of my program could run and be tested. |

### Assignment #5

| **Name** | Kyra Apodaca|
|:---|:---|
| **Name** | CS1-HW-Loop-GuessTheNumber |
| **Description** | Write a program that generates a random number and takes in user input to decide if the number is equal, higher, or lower |

| **Location** | https://github.com/kapodaca0316/CS1-knapodaca/blob/main/assignments/loops/main.cpp |
| **Self Grade** | 100/100 |
| **Notes** | The biggest issue I had was with the bonus. My program calculates the correct number of games played, won, and lost, but everytime I tried to calculate the percentage for it, I was getting 0 |

### Assignment #6

| **Name** | Kyra Apodaca|
|:---|:---|
| **Name** | CS1-HW-String-Apaxiaans |
| **Description** | Write program that will take in a string and replace any consecutively repeating letters with one instance of that letter |

| **Self Grade** | 100/100 |
| **Notes** | I took a lot of time to think through how to write the test functions, I think I did it right |
