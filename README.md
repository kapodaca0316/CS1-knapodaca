| **Due Date** | 10/12/2022 |
| **Status** | completed |
| **Location** | https://github.com/kapodaca0316/CS1-knapodaca/blob/main/labs/conditionals/main.cpp |
| **Self Grade** | 90/100 |
| **Notes** | I'm not positive I wrote the test function correctly |

### Assignment #1

| **Name** | Kyra Apodaca|
|:---|:---|
| **Name** | HW - Std I/O |
| **Description** | Homework covering standard input and output, console will print out hang man gallows |
| **Due Date** | 09/12/2022 |
| **Status** | completed |
| **Location** | https://github.com/kapodaca0316/CS1-knapodaca/blob/main/assignments/studio/main.cpp |
| **Self Grade** | 95/100 |
| **Notes** | wrote and tested the input/output multiple times |

### Assignment #2

| **Name** | Kyra Apodaca|
|:---|:---|
| **Name** | HW - Triangle Maths |
| **Description** | Homework covering basic cmath calculations and tell whether triangle is real or not |
| **Due Date** | 09/26/2022 |
| **Status** | completed |
| **Location** | https://github.com/kapodaca0316/CS1-knapodaca/blob/main/assignments/triangle/main.cpp |
| **Self Grade** | 95/100 |
| **Notes** | I tested it a bunch, the way I wrote it makes it so that the way to tell if the triangle is real or not the third side must be the hypotenuse and entered last into the program. There is a better way to write that, I just don't know what that would be |

### Assignment #3

| **Name** | Kyra Apodaca|
|:---|:---|
| **Name** | Lab - Built-in and User Defined Functions & Automated Testing Lab |
| **Description** | Write a C++ program that prompts the user to enter two points on a 2D geometry and finds the distance between the two points |
| **Due Date** | 10/06/2022 |
| **Status** | completed |
| **Location** | https://github.com/kapodaca0316/CS1-knapodaca/blob/main/assignments/functions/functions.cpp |
| **Self Grade** | 65/100 |
| **Notes** | This is late and I don't think it's calculating the distance properly. I should have used pow I think. |

### Assignment #4

| **Name** | Kyra Apodaca|
|:---|:---|
| **Name** | HW - CLI Menu, Conditionals, Functions and Testing |
| **Description** | Write a CLI based menu-driven C++ program that computes sum, product, max, min, average, oddity of any 5 given numbers along with the following requirements. |
| **Due Date** | 10/17/2022 |
| **Status** | completed |
| **Location** | https://github.com/kapodaca0316/CS1-knapodaca/blob/main/assignments/conditionals/conditional.cpp |
| **Self Grade** | 90/100 |
| **Notes** | I didn't know how to calculate the oddity, so I commented that out so the rest of my program could run and be tested. |
